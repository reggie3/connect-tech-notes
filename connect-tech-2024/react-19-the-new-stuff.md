# React 19: The New Stuff by Corey House

"The future is here. It's just not evenly distributed." William Gibson

- React query with useErrorBoundary or useSuspenseQuery - what are these


## New Features

- can edit head data as a JSX tag
- `useOptimistic` [hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useOptimistic)
- `useActionState` [hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState)
- `useFormStatus` [hook](): lets you read the status of a parent form
- forms don't require JS
- Some deprecated items are being removed
- `use` is not a hook, it is an API, it can be called conditionally, can be used to read resources (like promises and context).  Can pass a context to the `use` API such as `use(UserContext)`.  Makes it so you don't have to wrap a context in a custom hook like I usually do.
